      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>When was the last time you visited a website and left because it was too cluttered and difficult to navigate? 
          I want to create a website that provides necessary information about a non-profit organization that focuses on providing people of all ages recreational activities all year long. 
          This website will be designed so that anyone, even children, can navigate it while still being visually appealing.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People of all ages</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Images: 
        There will be a few images with one main image centered near the top of the site. Every image will be directly related to the organization and some of the activities held. 
        Design:
        The website will be designed with the organization’s theme in mind. The theme is based on the name Hyperspace. So colors that are often associated with space and neon lights would be used. 
        Links:
        There will be two links to the child pages. One of them is an “About Us” page that will describe the owners of the organization, their goal, and their motivation. It will also include an image of the owners. The other page is a registration page where the user will be able to sign up and book a time to go to the park. It will contain very little besides the required. Another option instead of a registration page is a FAQ page which would be much easier to code.
